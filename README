Simulated JTAG cable and device

ppsim.c - A Linux kernel module which provides a parallel (printer) port
          which emulates a simple JTAG bit-banging programming cable.
          Cable pinout allows use by Urjtag client.

jtag.c - Simulates a JTAG chain with one device with a 4 bit IR length.

benchtest.c - A test program which probes the simulated JTAG chain,
              either directly, or through the simulated cable.


Notes:

I think jtag.c is implemented correectly, but Urjtag client over estimates
register lengths by one.
